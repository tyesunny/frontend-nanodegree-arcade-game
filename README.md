# Arcade Game

## Instructions

* Download the project and open index.html to start playing.

* Goals/Winning
** In this game the goal is simple, get the hero character to move across the gray bricks towards the water without getting hit by the enemy bugs. The user's score increases by one point for each level passed. The number of enemy bugs also increase with each level and are randomly placed across the gray bricks at the start of each game.

* Movement and Controls
** Users move the hero character by using the main up/right/left/down arrow keys on their keyboard.
